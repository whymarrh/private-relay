A privacy-preserving TCP proxy based on Signal's [_Expanding Signal GIF search_][signal-and-giphy] article.

### What's the idea here?

From Signal's article:<sup>[\[1\]][signal-and-giphy]</sup>

> In order to hide your search term from GIPHY, the Signal service acts as a privacy-preserving proxy.
>
> When querying GIPHY:
>
> 1. The Signal app opens a TCP connection to the Signal service.
> 2. The Signal service opens a TCP connection to the GIPHY HTTPS API endpoint and relays bytes between the app and GIPHY.
> 3. The Signal app negotiates TLS through the proxied TCP connection all the way to the GIPHY HTTPS API endpoint.
>
> Since communication is done via TLS all the way to GIPHY, the Signal service never sees the plaintext contents of what
> is transmitted or received. Since the TCP connection is proxied through the Signal service, GIPHY doesn't know who
> issued the request.
>
> The Signal service essentially acts as a VPN for GIPHY traffic: the Signal service knows who you are, but not what
> you're searching for or selecting. The GIPHY API service sees the search term, but not who you are.

This proxy is an implementation of exactly that.

### What does this mean in practice?

***If you deployed*** an example proxy for [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org) to `relay.privaterelay.technology`. You could send requests
to httpbin.org through that proxy to hide your IP address from the service.

httpbin.org has a [`/ip`](https://httpbin.org/ip) endpoint that will return the requester's IP address:

```bash
curl -sSL 'https://httpbin.org/ip' | jq '.origin'
# => $ADDRESS1
curl -sSL --connect-to httpbin.org:443:relay.privaterelay.technology:443 'https://httpbin.org/ip' | jq '.origin'
# => $ADDRESS2
# Note that $ADDRESS1 ≠ $ADDRESS2
```

In the example above, `$ADDRESS1` is your external IP address, as expected, while `$ADDRESS2` is the IP address of the
proxy.

(See the cURL man page for: [`--connect-to <HOST1:PORT1:HOST2:PORT2>`][curl---connect-to])

### How does it work?

> *"It's just HAProxy"*

The proxy server runs HAProxy in TCP mode, and the TLS connection passes through. A useful diagram from the HAProxy
docs:<sup>[\[1\]][haproxy-tls-passthrough-docs]</sup>

[![HAProxy TLS pass-through diagram][haproxy-tls-passthrough]][haproxy-tls-passthrough-docs]

HAProxy does not and cannot decipher the traffic.

[You can see the full HAProxy configuration used in `proxy/haproxy.cfg`.](./proxy/haproxy.cfg)

### What is the benefit?

Privacy, mostly, at the cost of an extra TCP connection.

From Signal's article, again:<sup>[\[1\]][signal-and-giphy]</sup>

> [The proxy service] knows who you are, but not what you're searching for or selecting. The GIPHY API service sees
> the search term, but not who you are.

### How can I host my own proxy?

Fork the repo and configure it!

#### Architecture

There are two main components:

1. [Cloudflare Load Balancing](#cloudflare-load-balancing)
2. [HAProxy servers](#haproxy-servers)

##### Cloudflare Load Balancing

(**Note:** this is not used for load balancing per se, more a way of routing users to the closest HAProxy instance.)

The first component is a Cloudflare Load Balancer in DNS-Only mode with a 30 second TTL.

Operating in this mode does have a caveat:

> [This] relies on DNS resolvers respecting the short TTL to  re-query Cloudflare’s DNS for an updated list of healthy addresses.

The DNS-only load balancer does dynamic latency-based DNS resolution via [Dynamic Steering][cf-traffic-steering-dynamic]:

> Dynamic Steering uses health check data to identify the fastest pool for a given Cloudflare Region [...]
>
> Dynamic Steering creates Round Trip Time (RTT) profiles based on an exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) of RTT
> to determine the fastest pool. If there is no current RTT data for your pool in a region or colocation center,
> Cloudflare directs traffic to the pools in failover order.

##### HAProxy servers

As described above, HAProxy runs in TCP mode, and the TLS connection passes through. DigitalOcean hosts the HAProxy
servers.

#### Costs

> *"How much does this cost to host?"*

(All amounts are USD.)

The hosting costs depend on the configured regions and bandwidth usage.

The individual monthly costs:

- DigitalOcean droplet costs vary depending on the droplet size used
    - $5/month for `s-1vcpu-1gb`
- DigitalOcean bandwidth costs: (GB used − 1024 GB × # of droplets per region × # of regions total) × $0.01
    - e.g. 10 TB total outbound would be ~$50/month
- Cloudflare Load Balancing costs
    - $5/month base cost
    - $5/month per additional origin server ($5 × droplet count)
    - $15/month for 15s health checks ([`cloudflare_load_balancer_monitor.simple_tcp_monitor.interval`](./terraform/modules/cloudflare-digitalocean/main.tf))
    - $15 for RTTs in 8 regions
    - $10 for latency-based traffic steering ([`cloudflare_load_balancer.private_relay_lb.steering_policy`](./terraform/modules/cloudflare-digitalocean/main.tf))
    - $0.5 per 500,000 DNS queries

The total monthly costs for the config in this repository:
